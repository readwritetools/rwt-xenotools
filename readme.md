<table>

	<tr><td>The <span class=product>rwt-xenotools</span> DOM component links to popular tech forums to search for questions and answers related to this document's topic.</td></tr>
</table>

### Motivation

Sometimes visitors are unsatisfied with the information provided in your
document and need to further research the topic. As a convenience to your
visitors you can provide quick links to external forums that may have additional
information about the your document's main topic.

The <span>rwt-xenotools</span> DOM component facilitates this by
keeping a social-media style linkbar hidden at the bottom of the page until the
user needs it.

When activated, the linkbar slides over the page content, showing a collection
of icons associated with popular tech forums.

Activation may also be initiated through the component's `toggleMenu` method or
through its event interface.

The component has these features:

   * Each third-party link is prefilled with a query value that is determined by the
      document's `<meta content=xenotools:query>` value.
   * When appropriate, some links are prefilled with a hashtag values that are
      determined by the document's `<meta content=xenotools:tagged>` value.
   * The Reddit link uses any value provided by the document's `<meta content=xenotools:subreddit>`
value.
   * The Github link uses any value provided by the document's `<meta content=xenotools:language>`
value.
   * The linkbar has an event interface for showing and hiding itself.
   * The linkbar emits a custom event to close sibling menus and dialog boxes.
   * A keyboard listener is provided to allow a shortcut key to open/close the
      linkbar.

#### In the wild

To see an example of this component in use, visit the <a href='https://bluephrase.com'><span class=bp>BLUE</span><span class=phrase>PHRASE</span></a>
website and press <kbd>F6</kbd> "Link to Q&A forums". To understand what's going
on under the hood, use the browser's inspector to view the HTML source code and
network activity, and follow along as you read this documentation.

#### Prerequisites

The <span>rwt-xenotools</span> DOM component works in any browser that
supports modern W3C standards. Templates are written using <span>BLUE</span><span>
PHRASE</span> notation, which can be compiled into HTML using the free <a href='https://hub.readwritetools.com/desktop/rwview.blue'>Read Write View</a>
desktop app. It has no other prerequisites. Distribution and installation are
done with either NPM or via Github.

#### Installation using NPM

If you are familiar with Node.js and the `package.json` file, you'll be
comfortable installing the component just using this command:

```bash
npm install rwt-xenotools
```

If you are a front-end Web developer with no prior experience with NPM, follow
these general steps:

   * Install <a href='https://nodejs.org'>Node.js/NPM</a>
on your development computer.
   * Create a `package.json` file in the root of your web project using the command:
```bash
npm init
```

   * Download and install the DOM component using the command:
```bash
npm install rwt-xenotools
```


Important note: This DOM component uses Node.js and NPM and `package.json` as a
convenient *distribution and installation* mechanism. The DOM component itself
does not need them.

#### Installation using Github

If you are more comfortable using Github for installation, follow these steps:

   * Create a directory `node_modules` in the root of your web project.
   * Clone the <span>rwt-xenotools</span> DOM component into it using the
      command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/readwritetools/rwt-xenotools.git
```


### Using the DOM component

After installation, you need to add two things to your HTML page to make use of
it.

   * Add a `script` tag to load the component's `rwt-xenotools.js` file:
```html
<script src='/node_modules/rwt-xenotools/rwt-xenotools.js' type=module></script>             
```

   * Add the component tag somewhere on the page:
```html
<rwt-xenotools id=xenotools shortcut='F6' role=navigation />
```


#### Self identification

The linkbar's inputs are prefilled with values provided in the document's <meta>
tags. Here's an example:

```html
<meta name=xenotools:query content='h1, h2, h3' />
<meta name=xenotools:tagged content=html />
<meta name=xenotools:language content=HTML />
<meta name=xenotools:subreddit content=HTML5 />
```

### Customization

#### Dialog size and position

The linkbar is positioned in a fixed location at the bottom of the viewport. Its
position and size may be overridden using CSS by defining new values for the
bottom, width and height variables.

```css
rwt-xenotools {
    --bottom: 3rem;
    --height: 11rem;
    --width: 30rem;
}
```

#### Dialog color scheme

The default color palette for the dialog uses a dark mode theme. You can use CSS
to override the variables' defaults:

```css
rwt-xenotools {
    --color: var(--white);
    --accent-color1: var(--pure-white);
    --background-color: var(--nav-black);
    --accent-background1: var(--pure-black);
    --accent-background2: var(--medium-black);
    --accent-background3: var(--light-black);
    --accent-background4: var(--title-blue);
    --border-color1: var(--gray);    
    --border-color2: var(--pure-white);    
    --border-color3: var(--pure-black);    
}
```

### Life-cycle events

The component issues life-cycle events.


<dl>
	<dt><code>component-loaded</code></dt>
	<dd>Sent when the component is fully loaded and ready to be used. As a convenience you can use the <code>waitOnLoading()</code> method which returns a promise that resolves when the <code>component-loaded</code> event is received. Call this asynchronously with <code>await</code>.</dd>
</dl>
